You may not use or distribute this Software or any derivative works in any form for

Examples of commercial purposes would be running business operations, licensing, 
leasing, or selling the Software, distributing the Software for use with commercial

that are different from those provided by this MSR-SSLA. 
4.      That if you have created derivative works of the Software, and distribute such 
derivative works, you will cause the modified files to carry prominent notices so 
that recipients know that they are not receiving the original Software. Such notices 
must state: (i) that you have changed the Software; and (ii) the date of any 
changes.
5.      That Microsoft is granted back, without any restrictions or limitations, a non-
exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, assignable and sub-licensable 
license, to reproduce, publicly perform or display, install, use, modify, distribute,

DISTRIBUTE THE SOFTWARE OR DERIVATIVE WORKS.
9.      That we have no duty of reasonable care or lack of negligence, and we are not 
obligated to provide any technical support, updates or any other form of support 
for the Software, but if any support or updates are provided (which shall be solely 
in our discretion), they shall be deemed part of the Software and governed by this 
Agreement.  The provision of any Software technical support, updates or other 
support shall in no way be deemed to create any further obligation of Microsoft to

10.     That if you breach this MSR-SSLA or if you sue anyone over patents that you think

places.  You agree to comply with all such laws and regulations that may apply to

most nearly captures the intent of the original language.
